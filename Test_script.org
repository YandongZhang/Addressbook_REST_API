The test were mainly done in a windows 10 computer.The projects includes two .go file in a single directory.Before the test, we use the below command to generate an addressbook file including 10 (you can change the number freely) entries.
These entries are saved in a file named as "myaddressbook.csv"
---------------------

go run createaddressbook.go 10
---------------------

*** start the server 

go run server.go

*** json format for curl.exe in windows 10 system

For the curl.exe in the windows 10 system, the internal double quote should be led by a forward slash.
The whole json body should be currounded by double quote, not single quote.
For example:
"{\"Id\":\"2X\"}"

In linux system, the forward slash should be removed and the json should look like:
'{"Id":"2X"}'

*** readall: browser will read all entries in the addressbook 

curl localhost/readall

*** add an entry with the Id=2X

curl -d "{\"ID\":\"2X\",\"Firstname\":\"Firstname0\",\"Lastname\":\"Lastname0\",\"Email\":\"Email0@email.com\",\"Phonenumber\":\"Phonenumber0\"}" localhost/appendentry

*** delete an entry with Id=2

curl -d "{\"ID\":\"2\"}" localhost/deleteentry

*** try to delete an entry with wrong ID

curl -d "{\"ID\":\"notexist\"}" localhost/deleteentry

*** modify an entry with Id=2X

curl -d "{\"ID\":\"2X\",\"Firstname\":\"Firstname_M\",\"Lastname\":\"Lastname0\",\"Email\":\"Email0@email.com\",\"Phonenumber\":\"Phonenumber0\"}" localhost/modifyentry

*** modify a non-exist entry by using the wrong ID

curl -d "{\"ID\":\"noexist\",\"Firstname\":\"Firstname_M\",\"Lastname\":\"Lastname0\",\"Email\":\"Email0@email.com\",\"Phonenumber\":\"Phonenumber0\"}" localhost/modifyentry

*** Upload the xxx1.csv file to the server and replace the originial addressbook

curl localhost/uploadaddressbook -F "file=@tobeuploaded.csv"

*** Download the addressbook file to the local directory and saved it as "myfile.csv"

curl localhost/downloadaddressbook --output myfile.csv

*** read an entry by the given Id; 

curl -d "{\"Id\":\"2\"}" localhost/readentry
*** read an entry by using the wrong Id; 
curl -d "{\"Id\":\"no exist\"}" localhost/readentry
